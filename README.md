## Development Process

### What I Worked On
- Built a responsive weather dashboard with real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Implemented dynamic music recommendations based on weather conditions and temperature
- Created a modern, gradient-based UI with glassmorphism effects
- Added quick-access buttons for popular cities
- Developed comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Ensured mobile responsiveness across all screen sizes

### Issues Encountered
Initially tried to include local news functionality alongside weather data, but ran into significant challenges with accessing news APIs and filtering relevant news content for specific cities. The news API integration proved problematic due to CORS restrictions and difficulty in obtaining location-specific, relevant news content. Decided to pivot to music recommendations instead, which provided a more seamless user experience and better complemented the weather data.
